# cms-snippets
A place to keep little snippets of html and css for common elements we like to make in for various Library web properties, such as Cascade and LibApps! For PrimoVE repo content, see [our GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/ucsdlibrary/development/primo-stage/-/tree/trunk?ref_type=heads).

### File descriptions for Cascade Snippets
- **website-background.html** — Use to set a background image for an entire webpage in the CMS. Please note that image should conform to the overall campus design direction.  

- **mini-profile.html** — Use to create a mini profile with a circular profile image.
  
- **timeline-large.html** — Accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for larger timelines. https://library.ucsd.edu/about/strategic-plan/index.html

- **timeline-small.html** — Initial version of accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for smaller timelines. Decided to go with a different design direction, but this snippet could be re-purposed for something else!
