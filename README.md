# DX-Components
A place to keep our html components (in LibApps and Cascade CMS) and our scripts for web utilities. For PrimoVE repo content, see [our GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/ucsdlibrary/development/primo-stage/-/tree/trunk?ref_type=heads).

### File descriptions for Cascade Snippets
- **website-background.html** — Use to set a background image for an entire webpage in the CMS. Please note that image should conform to the overall campus design direction.  

- **mini-profile.html** — Use to create a mini profile with a circular profile image.
  
- **timeline-large.html** — Accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for larger timelines. https://library.ucsd.edu/about/strategic-plan/index.html

- **timeline-small.html** — Initial version of accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for smaller timelines. Decided to go with a different design direction, but this snippet could be re-purposed for something else!
