# API Explorations

## About
    The Library utilizes a variety of 3rd party software tools to support the research needs and intellectual curiosity of its community. While we have explored and leveraged the customization features of these platforms, to align their interfaces with campus brand, we have largely left the APIs these 3rd parties offer their customers. Engaging their APIs would allow to leverage their tools' application logic while presenting it in an interface with our custom look-and-feel and other hybrid (3rd party/Library) functionality. This corner of the DX-Components repo is dedicated to exploring the functionality of the aforementioned APIs, detailing which API calls might be of use to DX idea garden projects or general __notice__ improvements to exisiting web properties or front-end applications. Each sub directory will have its own README the respective documentation.
