## :file_folder: File descriptions for Cascade Modules & Micro Service Scripts

- **Campus-modules-cloned**: Holds html files of modules from campus that we use in typical page builds. This space is for module modification or understanding how a module works.

- **custom-modules**: Holds html files for custom modules that have been approved by Web Manager & Content Strategist for regular content editor workflows.

- **look-and-feel**: Directory can be used to test modules, style/script updates, and micro-servicing scripts in a site-like environment. Requires a code editor.

- **website-background.html**: Use to set a background image for an entire webpage in the CMS. Please note that image should conform to the overall campus design direction.  

- **mini-profile.html**: Use to create a mini profile with a circular profile image.
  
- **timeline-large.html**: Accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for larger timelines. https://library.ucsd.edu/about/strategic-plan/index.html

- **timeline-small.html**: Initial version of accessible visual timeline for Library Strategic Plan page. Would work best for smaller timelines. Decided to go with a different design direction, but this snippet could be re-purposed for something else!
